# Innovation Days

## Presentations

Every Tuesday at 11:00 IRST, we have a two-hour gathering called “Innovation Day” to share knowledge and enhance our programming skills.

Each session comprises two sections. First, everyone reads independently. Then, during the final 20-40 minutes, a volunteer presents a topic of their choice.

List of presentations, presenter name, and the chosen topics is available in the following document:
